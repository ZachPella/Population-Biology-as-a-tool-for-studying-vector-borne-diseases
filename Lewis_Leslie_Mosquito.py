    This interactive application simulates mosquito population dynamics using a Leslie Matrix model as described 
    in population biology studies of vector-borne diseases. The model demonstrates how age structure, 
    survivorship, and fecundity affect vectorial capacity - a critical component in disease transmission.
    
    ### Model Concepts from Literature:
    - **Leslie Matrix Model**: A discrete, age-structured approach representing different life stages
    - **Vectorial Capacity**: The average number of potentially infective bites delivered by vectors feeding on a host in one day
    - **Stable Age Distribution (SAD)**: The constant proportion of individuals in each age class that emerges over time

        **Interpretation of Population Growth Patterns:**
        
        This visualization reveals how mosquito populations grow over time based on the Leslie Matrix model. 
        The relative trajectories of eggs, larvae, and adults exhibit patterns that follow principles from 
        the readings:
        
        1. **Exponential Growth Phase**: Initially, the population grows exponentially similar to Figure 24.4 
           from the readings, where r > 0 and resources are not limiting.
        
        2. **Oscillatory Dynamics**: The cyclical patterns in population numbers reflect the gonotrophic cycles 
           of adult females, where reproduction occurs following blood meals as described in Figure 24.7A.
        
        3. **Life Stage Lags**: Note the time delay between peaks in eggs, larvae, and adults, representing the 
           developmental time lags that determine vector population age structure and transmission potential.
        
        4. When density dependence is enabled, the population eventually approaches the carrying capacity (K) 
           as described in the logistic growth model (Equation 15 from the readings).

        - The oscillations in growth rate reflect the pulsed nature of mosquito reproduction after blood meals
        
        This pattern aligns with the population dynamics described in Figure 24.3 from the readings, where 
        growth rates fluctuate over time due to the interaction of fecundity, survivorship, and age structure.

        **Stable Age Distribution (SAD) Analysis:**
        
        This visualization demonstrates how the proportion of each life stage evolves over time, eventually 
        reaching a stable equilibrium. This concept is central to the Leslie Matrix theory and is explicitly 
        illustrated in Figure 24.11 from the readings.
        
        Key observations:
        
        1. **Initial Instability**: Early population structure shows oscillations as the model equilibrates from 
           the starting conditions.
        
        2. **Convergence to Stability**: Over time, the relative proportions of eggs, larvae, and adults reach 
           a constant distribution - this is the Stable Age Distribution (SAD).
        
        3. **Stage Proportions**: The final proportions reflect the survival rates and stage durations you've chosen. 
           Stages with higher survival rates and longer durations tend to accumulate more individuals.
        
        4. **Applied Significance**: The SAD is critical for vector control as it determines what proportion of 
           the population is in the adult biting stage capable of disease transmission.
        
        The SAD emerges from the mathematics of the Leslie Matrix and reflects the underlying life history 
        parameters - a key insight from the Lewis-Leslie age structure model in the readings.

        **Age Structure Interpretation:**
        
        This visualization illustrates the discrete age-class distribution (n vector) that forms the foundation 
        of the Leslie Matrix model as shown in Figure 24.8 of the readings. Each horizontal bar represents a 
        single day age class, revealing the detailed population structure that aggregate counts conceal.
        
        Important features:
        
        1. **Reproductive Age Classes**: Red bars indicate ages when adult females take blood meals and produce 
           eggs (reproductive ages). These correspond to the non-zero values in the first row of the Leslie Matrix.
        
        2. **Stage Transitions**: Dotted lines mark the transitions between life stages - eggs to larvae, and 
           larvae to adults. These transitions incorporate the stage-specific survival probabilities.
        
        3. **Population Bottlenecks**: Narrow sections in the distribution identify critical points in the 
           life cycle where interventions might have maximum impact.
        
        4. **Cohort Progression**: By comparing across different days, you can track how cohorts move through 
           the age structure over time, revealing patterns of survival and mortality.
        
        This detailed age structure is central to the Leslie Matrix approach and provides insights that

        **Cohort Survival Analysis:**
        
        This survival curve tracks a cohort of individuals from egg deposition through development, 
        illustrating mortality patterns described as survivorship curves in Figure 24.6 of the readings. 
        The slope and shape of this curve reveal fundamental characteristics of the vector population:
        
        1. **Survivorship Type**: The pattern shown here can be classified according to the three types described 
           in the readings:
           - **Type I**: Low early mortality, death concentrated in old age (tsetse flies)
           - **Type II**: Constant mortality rate throughout life (many mosquito species)
           - **Type III**: High early mortality, few reaching maturity (ticks, most egg-laying insects)
        
        2. **Transition Vulnerabilities**: The vertical lines mark transitions between life stages where survival 
           rates change, often representing critical periods for population regulation.
        
        3. **Epidemiological Significance**: From a disease transmission perspective, the cohort survival 
           beyond the extrinsic incubation period determines the proportion of vectors that live long 
           enough to become infectious - a key component of vectorial capacity.
        
        These survival patterns directly inform vector control strategies - targeting stages with the steepest 
        mortality curves may yield the greatest population reduction per unit effort.

            **Survivorship Pattern Classification:**
            
            Based on the survival curve shown above, this cohort follows a **{survival_pattern}** survivorship pattern 
            as characterized in the readings. The pattern is determined by:
            
            - **Survival profile**: {early_survival.mean():.1f}% survival in early stages, {late_survival.mean():.1f}% in late stages
            - **Stage-specific survival rates**: Eggs ({egg_survival:.2f}), Larvae ({larval_survival:.2f}), Adults ({adult_survival:.2f})
            
            **Type II survivorship** is most common in mosquitoes and is characterized by a relatively constant 
            mortality rate throughout life. This creates a linear decline when plotted on a logarithmic scale, 
            as shown in the graph above.

            vectorial capacity. Type II curves with high adult survival rates are particularly concerning 
            for disease transmission because they allow more individuals to survive through the extrinsic

                    This value is calculated using the method described in Equation 17 of the readings:

                    - p = daily survival probability

        **Leslie Matrix & Life Table Analysis:**
        
        The Leslie Matrix is the core mathematical foundation of this population model, as detailed 
        in Figure 24.8 of the readings. The matrix incorporates two fundamental life history components:
        
        1. **Survival probabilities** (subdiagonal elements): The probability that individuals of each 
           age class survive to the next age class
        
        2. **Fecundity values** (first row elements): The number of offspring produced by individuals 
           in each reproductive age class
        
        This implementation follows the structure described in the readings where:
        
        - **M matrix**: The transition matrix shown in the heatmap below
        - **n‚Çç‚Çú‚Çé**: The population vector at time t (shown in the Age Structure tab)
        - **n‚Çç‚Çú‚Çä‚ÇÅ‚Çé**: The population vector at time t+1, calculated as M √ó n‚Çç‚Çú‚Çé
        
        The matrix approach efficiently captures both age-dependent survival and reproduction, allowing 
        for realistic simulation of vector population dynamics and prediction of the stable age 
        distribution that emerges over time.

    ### Application to Vector-Borne Disease Control
    
    This Leslie Matrix model provides critical insights for vector control strategies by showing how 
    stage-specific interventions affect overall population dynamics and vectorial capacity. Based on concepts 
    from the readings, particularly Figure 24.13, control strategies can be evaluated for their 
    epidemiological impact:
    
    1. **Targeting Approaches**:
       - **Larvicidal strategies**: Target aquatic stages, reducing future adult populations
       - **Adulticidal strategies**: Directly reduce biting populations and disease transmission
       - **Environmental management**: Modify carrying capacity by reducing breeding sites
    
    2. **Relative Effectiveness**:
       - As shown in the readings, reducing adult survivorship has an exponentially greater effect on 
         vectorial capacity than reducing vector density
       - However, larval control may be more cost-effective and environmentally sustainable
    
    3. **Transmission Thresholds**:
       - Effective control requires reducing populations below critical thresholds for disease transmission
       - These thresholds depend on the interaction of vector density, survival, and competence
    
    4. **Implementation Considerations**:
       - Different control approaches exhibit different time delays between implementation and effect
       - Combined strategies targeting multiple life stages may provide synergistic benefits

    The plot above shows how different control strategies affect adult mosquito populations over time. 
    This directly relates to Figure 24.13 in the readings, which analyzes the effectiveness of varying 
    survival probabilities on final population sizes.
    
    **Key Observations:**
    
    1. **Adult Control (Gray Line)**:
       - Shows the most immediate impact on population reduction
       - Directly targets the epidemiologically important life stage
       - As emphasized in the readings, reducing adult survival by 50% can reduce vectorial capacity 
         by >90% due to exponential effects on survival through the extrinsic incubation period
    
    2. **Larval Control (Orange Line)**:
       - Shows a delayed effect as the impact filters through the population structure
       - Requires sustained implementation to achieve long-term reduction
       - More sustainable for long-term management but less effective for immediate outbreak control
    
    3. **Time to Effect**:
       - Adult control produces results within days
       - Larval control requires at least one generation time to significantly impact adult numbers
    
    **Implementation Implications:**
    
    The ideal control strategy depends on the specific context:
    - Emergency outbreak response: Focus on adult control for immediate reduction
    - Long-term prevention: Implement larval control for sustainable management
    - Integrated vector management: Combine both approaches for maximum effectiveness

        ### Vectorial Capacity Interpretation
        
        The calculated vectorial capacity of **{vectorial_capacity:.4f}** represents the average number of 
        potentially infective bites that would eventually arise from all the vectors that bite a single 
        infectious host on a single day. This concept is central to the readings, particularly in the 
        discussion of Macdonald's equation.
        
        **Formula Components:**
        
        The formula V = [ma¬≤bp‚Åø]/[-ln(p)] shows how different parameters contribute to transmission potential:
        
        1. **Vector density (m)**: Linear relationship - doubling vector density doubles vectorial capacity
        
        2. **Biting rate (a)**: Quadratic relationship - appears as a¬≤ because vectors must bite twice 
           (once to acquire infection, once to transmit)
        
        3. **Vector competence (b)**: Linear relationship - proportion of vectors that successfully 
           develop infection after feeding
        
        4. **Daily survival (p)**: Complex relationship - appears as both p^n (probability of surviving 
           through extrinsic incubation) and in denominator as -ln(p) (related to lifespan)
        
        5. **Extrinsic incubation period (n)**: Inverse exponential relationship - longer periods reduce 
           vectorial capacity as fewer vectors survive long enough
        
        **Sensitivity Analysis:**
        
        As demonstrated in Table 24.1 from the readings, vectorial capacity is most sensitive to changes 
        in daily survival probability (p), with modest changes in p causing dramatic shifts in transmission 
        potential. This explains why adulticidal control measures targeting mosquito longevity are often 
        more effective than those reducing density.

    ### From Vector Biology to Disease Transmission
    
    This Leslie Matrix model provides a complete framework for understanding how vector population 
    dynamics influence disease transmission potential. The connections to epidemiology include:
    
    1. **Age-Structured Transmission Risk**:
       - Only adult female mosquitoes that have survived beyond the extrinsic incubation period can 
         transmit pathogens
       - The age structure of the population determines what proportion of vectors are in this 
         infectious category
    
    2. **Vector Control Optimization**:
       - Targeting adult survival has the greatest impact on vectorial capacity
       - However, larval control may be more feasible and sustainable in many settings
       - Optimal strategies depend on local ecological conditions and vector life histories
    
    3. **Transmission Dynamics**:
       - The Reed-Frost model discussed in the readings connects vector population dynamics to 
         human case incidence
       - The basic reproduction number (R‚ÇÄ) depends directly on vectorial capacity
    
    4. **Mathematical Integration**:
       - The Leslie Matrix approach provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for predicting how 
         environmental changes and control measures will affect disease risk
       - This allows evidence-based planning of vector control programs
    
    This model demonstrates how fundamental ecological principles can inform public health practices 
    for vector-borne disease control, as emphasized throughout the readings.
