    This interactive application simulates mosquito population dynamics using a Leslie Matrix model as described 
    in population biology studies of vector-borne diseases (Black & Moore). The model demonstrates how age structure, 
    survivorship, and fecundity affect vectorial capacity - a critical component in disease transmission.
    
    ### Model Concepts from Literature:
    - **Leslie Matrix Model**: A discrete, age-structured approach representing different life stages
    - **Vectorial Capacity**: The average number of potentially infective bites delivered by vectors feeding on a host in one day
    - **Stable Age Distribution (SAD)**: The constant proportion of individuals in each age class that emerges over time

    2. **Efficacy Estimation**: Models help predict population responses to control measures

    ### Interpretation of Control Strategies
    
    The above graph shows the expected effect of different control strategies:
    
    1. **Baseline**: Current parameters with no intervention
    2. **Larval Control**: 50% reduction in larval survival rate
    3. **Adult Control**: 50% reduction in adult survival rate
    
    These results highlight how targeting different life stages affects the overall population dynamics.
    The comparative effectiveness of these strategies depends on the current survival rates of each stage, 
    reproductive patterns, density dependence, and immigration/emigration.
    
    In general, reducing adult survival has a more immediate impact on vectorial capacity because it:
    1. Directly reduces the biting population
    2. Has exponential effects on vector survival through the extrinsic incubation period
    3. Reduces the number of individuals reaching reproductive age
    
    However, in some ecological contexts, larval control may be more sustainable and cost-effective.

        ### Interpretation of Vectorial Capacity
        
        The calculated vectorial capacity value of **{vectorial_capacity:.4f}** represents the average number of 
        potentially infective bites that could arise from all mosquitoes that bite an infectious host on a single day.
        
        This value is derived from Macdonald's equation as discussed in the readings, and reflects the combined effects of:
        
        1. **Vector density** (m): More mosquitoes per person increases transmission potential
        2. **Biting frequency** (a): Appears as a squared term because vectors must bite twice (to acquire and transmit)
        3. **Daily survival** (p): Appears both as p^n and in the denominator, making it extremely influential
        4. **Extrinsic incubation** (n): Longer incubation reduces vectorial capacity as fewer mosquitoes survive long enough
        
        The vectorial capacity calculation shows why adult survival rate (p) is the most sensitive parameter in disease 
        transmission - small changes in daily survival produce large changes in vectorial capacity, as seen in 
        the control strategy comparison above.
