    st.markdown("""
    This interactive application simulates mosquito population dynamics using a Leslie Matrix model based on 
    population biology principles for studying vector and pest populations.
    Adjust the parameters using the sliders and see how they affect the population growth.
    
    **Definition**: The Leslie Matrix model is a discrete-time, age-structured population model that describes 
    population growth when age-specific survival rates and reproductive rates can be estimated. It's a fundamental 
    mathematical tool in population ecology, representing stage transitions and fecundity in a matrix format.
    
    **Core Concept**: At the heart of the Leslie Matrix model is the projection of current population structure 
    to future time steps through matrix multiplication. The matrix contains survival probabilities on the sub-diagonal 
    and fecundity values in the first row.
    
    **Leslie Matrix Equation**: 
    $n_{t+1} = M Ã— n_{t}$
    
    Where:
    - $n_{t+1}$ is the population vector at the next time step
    - $M$ is the Leslie Matrix containing survival rates and fecundity values
    - $n_{t+1}$ is the current population vector by age class
    
    **The Model's Logic**:
    1. Each age class has a specific survival probability to the next age class
    2. Only certain adult age classes reproduce, with age-specific fecundity
    3. The population structure changes over time until reaching a stable age distribution
    4. The matrix eigenvalue determines whether the population grows, shrinks, or stabilizes

     **Parameters:**
    - **Egg survival rate**: Daily survival probability for eggs in the oothecae (egg cases)
    - **Nymphal survival rate**: Daily survival probability for nymphs (immature cockroaches)
    - **Adult survival rate**: Daily survival probability for adult cockroaches
    - **Initial population**: Starting number of individuals
    - **Fecundity values**: Number of eggs produced at different adult ages

    Where:
    - $m$ = vector density in relation to hosts
    - $a$ = biting rate (humans bitten per mosquito per day)
    - $p$ = daily survival rate (especially of adults)
    - $n$ = extrinsic incubation period (days from ingestion to transmission)
    
    ### Adjustable Parameters:
    - **Survival rates** for each life stage (eggs, larvae, adults)
    - **Duration** of each life stage
    - **Fecundity** after each blood meal
    - **Initial population** size
    - **Density dependence** and immigration (optional)
    
    This model demonstrates how small changes in daily survival rates and age structure can dramatically affect both population growth and disease transmission potential.

        **Mosquito Population Growth Dynamics:**
        
        This visualization reveals characteristic growth patterns in mosquito populations, with several important features:
        
        1. **Pulse Reproduction Pattern**: Mosquitoes show distinct pulses of reproduction as females take blood meals at 
           regular intervals, creating the step-like increases in egg numbers. This pattern corresponds directly to the 
           gonotrophic cycles described in Black & Moore.
        
        2. **Stage Duration Effects**: The relative lengths of egg and larval stages create a time-delayed pattern of 
           population growth, with waves of individuals moving through developmental stages. This developmental timing 
           directly influences vectorial capacity.
        
        3. **Control Implications**: For vector management, this growth curve suggests that interventions targeting 
           adults before they reproduce will be most effective at reducing disease transmission. The exponential nature 
           of the growth curve demonstrates why early detection and intervention are crucial.

        **Growth Rate Pattern Analysis:**
        
        The growth rate plot reveals how mosquito populations expand over time. The mean daily growth rate 
        of {mean_growth:.2f}% translates to significant population increases over short periods.
        
        Key observations:
        
        1. **Cyclical Growth Patterns**: The spikes in growth rate correspond to the maturation of large 
           cohorts of larvae into reproductive adults, followed by blood meals and egg-laying events. These 
           cycles create predictable windows for control interventions.
        
        2. **Initial Establishment Phase**: Vector populations typically show a lag phase with lower 
           growth rates followed by a rapid acceleration as multiple reproducing females become established. 
           This pattern mirrors the logistic growth equation described in Black & Moore's chapter.
        
        3. **Carrying Capacity Effects**: When density dependence is enabled, growth rates would eventually decline 
           as populations approach carrying capacity due to resource limitations and density-dependent factors.

            **Mosquito Stage Distribution Dynamics:**
            
            This visualization shows how the mosquito population structure evolves over time, eventually reaching 
            a stable age distribution (SAD) - a fundamental concept in population biology described in Black & Moore. 
            In mosquito populations, this structural pattern has important implications:
            
            1. **Hidden Reservoir Effect**: The high proportion of eggs and larvae (often >70% of the total 
               population) explains why mosquito populations can quickly rebound after control efforts targeting only adults.
               This "population iceberg" effect is critical for vector management planning.
            
            2. **Resilience Mechanism**: The extended development time of larvae creates a buffer against control 
               measures - even if all adults are eliminated, the larval reservoir ensures population recovery. 
               This resilience mechanism is similar to the "demographic momentum" described in population models.
            
            3. **Vectorial Capacity Implications**: The stable age distribution directly affects disease transmission potential
               by determining what proportion of the population survives to ages capable of transmitting pathogens.
               As described in Macdonald's equation, only older females contribute to disease spread.

        **Mosquito Population Age Structure:**
        
        This visualization displays the detailed age distribution of the mosquito population, revealing patterns 
        that are not apparent in the aggregated life stage counts:
        
        1. **Blood Meal Timing**: The red bars indicate ages when females take blood meals and produce eggs. 
           Unlike species with continuous reproduction, mosquitoes show distinct reproductive pulses following 
           each blood meal, creating cohorts that move through the population together.
        
        2. **Development Bottlenecks**: Transitions between life stages (marked by dotted lines) represent 
           vulnerable periods in the mosquito life cycle. For example, pupation and adult emergence may be 
           more susceptible to environmental stressors, creating windows of opportunity for control.
        
        3. **Transmission Implications**: Only adult mosquitoes that survive beyond the extrinsic incubation 
           period (typically 10-14 days post-emergence) can transmit disease. This age structure directly 
           affects vectorial capacity as described in Black & Moore's model.
        
        4. **Cohort Identification**: The distinct "waves" of individuals at specific ages indicates separate 
           cohorts moving through the population, reflecting the pulsed reproduction pattern following gonotrophic cycles.
