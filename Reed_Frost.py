    ### Introduction to the Reed-Frost Model
    
    This interactive application simulates the spread of infectious disease using the Reed-Frost chain binomial model. 
    Adjust the parameters using the sliders and see how they affect the epidemic curve and disease dynamics.
    
    **Definition**: The Reed-Frost model is a discrete-time epidemic model that describes how a disease spreads through a population over distinct time periods or generations. It is a fundamental mathematical tool in epidemiology, representing a simplified framework for understanding disease transmission dynamics.
    
    **Core Concept**: At the heart of the Reed-Frost model is the probability of effective contact (P) between infected and susceptible individuals. For some diseases, this probability is high (e.g., influenza), while for others it is low (e.g., leprosy) or requires special forms of contact (e.g., HIV).
    
    **Reed-Frost Equation**: 
    $C_{t+1} = S_t \cdot (1 - (1-p)^{C_t})$ 
    
    Where:
    - $C_{t+1}$ is the number of new cases in the next time period
    - $S_t$ is the number of susceptible individuals in the current time period
    - $p$ is the probability of effective contact between an infected and susceptible individual
    - $C_t$ is the number of cases in the current time period
    
    **The Model's Logic**: 
    1. Each infectious individual makes contact with every other individual in the population during a time period
    2. The probability that a contact between an infectious and susceptible individual will lead to a new infection is P
    3. The probability that a susceptible escapes infection from any single case is (1-P)
    4. The probability that a susceptible escapes infection from all cases is $(1-P)^{C_t}$
    5. Therefore, the probability of becoming infected is $1-(1-P)^{C_t}$
    
    ### Adjustable Parameters:
    - **P**: The probability of effective contact between infected and susceptible individuals
    - **C0**: The initial number of cases in the population
    - **S0**: The initial number of susceptible individuals
    - **B**: Birth rate per time period (adds new susceptibles)
    - **I**: Immigration rate per time period (adds new susceptibles)
    - **D**: Death rate per time period (applies to all population groups)
    - **M**: Mortality rate from disease (applies only to active cases)
    
    This model was originally developed to understand epidemics in closed populations, but can be modified to account for population dynamics like births, deaths, and immigration, allowing for the study of endemic diseases and more complex transmission patterns.

        ### The Reed-Frost Chain Binomial Model
        
        The Reed-Frost model is a discrete-time (generation-based) epidemic model that describes how disease spreads through a population in distinct time periods. The epidemic curve illustrates the core components of the model:
        
        **Susceptible Population (Blue)**: Individuals who have not yet been infected but are capable of becoming infected if they come into contact with the disease.
        
        **Active Cases (Red)**: Infected individuals who can transmit the disease to susceptibles. The Reed-Frost model assumes these individuals contact everyone in the population during their infectious period.
        
        **Immune Population (Green)**: Individuals who have recovered from infection and acquired immunity, preventing reinfection.
        
        **Key Equation**: $C_{t+1} = S_t \cdot (1 - (1-p)^{C_t})$, where $C_{t+1}$ is new cases in the next time period, $S_t$ is susceptibles in the current time period, $p$ is probability of effective contact, and $C_t$ is current cases.
        """)
        
        st.write("""
        ### Dynamics of the Epidemic Curve
        
        **Probability of Effective Contact (P={})**: This parameter significantly impacts disease transmission. Higher P values lead to faster spread and larger outbreaks.
        
        **Outbreak Size**: With the current parameters, approximately {}% of the initial population became infected, with peak cases of {} occurring at generation {}.
        
        **Threshold Effects**: The model demonstrates that below certain thresholds of P, epidemics may not occur at all, while higher values cause rapid spread.
        
        **Population Dynamics**: With birth rate (B={}) and immigration (I={}), new susceptibles enter the population, potentially sustaining transmission longer than in a closed population.
        
        **Immunity Effects**: As the susceptible population (blue) declines and immune population (green) increases, the epidemic naturally slows due to reduced availability of susceptible individuals.

As shown in the Reed-Frost equation $C_{t+1} = S_t \\cdot (1 - (1-p)^{C_t})$, P directly determines how many susceptibles become infected in each generation.
            
            **Key observations from the model:**
            - At P values below 0.1, epidemics may not establish (or "take off")
            - As P increases from 0.1 to 0.5, both the peak height and total cases increase rapidly
            - At high P values (>0.5), the epidemic curve shifts left, reaching peak faster
            - The final size of the epidemic is highly sensitive to even small changes in P
            
            **Mathematical insight**: The nonlinear relationship between P and total cases emerges from the compounding effect of multiple generations of transmission. Small reductions in P are amplified over successive infection cycles.

            ### Initial Cases (C0)
            
            The **initial number of cases (C0)** represents the seed of the epidemic. The Reed-Frost model demonstrates that while C0 affects the timing of the epidemic, it has limited impact on the final epidemic size in closed populations.
            
            **Key observations from the model:**
            - Higher C0 values cause the epidemic to reach its peak earlier
            - Final epidemic size remains nearly constant regardless of C0, provided P is sufficient for epidemic spread
            - In deterministic models, even a single case (C0=1) will cause an epidemic if P is above threshold
            - The timing shift occurs because more initial cases create more infections in the first generation
                        
            **Mathematical insight**: The Reed-Frost equation shows that timing shifts occur because a larger C0 value increases the initial force of infection $(1-(1-P)^{C_t})$, but the overall epidemic trajectory follows similar dynamics once established.

            The **initial susceptible population (S0)** directly determines the potential size of the epidemic. The Reed-Frost model demonstrates a proportional relationship between S0 and both peak cases and total infected.
            
            **Key observations from the model:**
            - Total cases scale almost linearly with S0 when other parameters remain constant
            - Peak height increases proportionally with S0
            - The shape of the epidemic curve remains similar, just scaled by population size
            - Time to peak is only slightly affected by S0 (larger populations peak marginally later)
                        
            **Mathematical insight**: In the Reed-Frost equation, S0 appears as a direct multiplier of new cases. However, the actual fraction of susceptibles who become infected depends on the probability of effective contact (P) and the overall population dynamics.

            **Key observations from the model:**
            - With B=0, the epidemic follows a single wave pattern that eventually burns out
            - As B increases, the tail of the epidemic curve extends, creating potential for multiple waves
            - At high enough birth rates, a steady endemic state may establish

            **Key observations from the model:**
            - Immigration creates a continuous inflow of susceptibles that can maintain transmission
            - Unlike birth rate which scales with population size, immigration is typically modeled as a constant inflow
            - Even low immigration rates can prevent epidemic burnout if P is sufficient

This makes immigration particularly important in metapopulation models that consider connected geographic regions.

            **Key observations from the model:**
            - Higher death rates reduce the total population size over time

            **Key observations from the model:**
            - Disease mortality reduces the number of infected individuals who transition to immunity
            - Higher disease mortality can slightly reduce transmission by shortening the infectious period
            - The effect on epidemic dynamics is usually small unless M is very high

The sensitivity analysis shows how variations in this parameter affect both the epidemic curve shape and final outcome.

                The probability of effective contact (P) and the initial susceptible population (Sâ‚€) interact in ways that directly relate to the Reed-Frost equation $C_{t+1} = S_t \\cdot (1 - (1-p)^{C_t})$. The heatmap reveals:
            
                - **Epidemic Threshold**: At low P values (<0.1), epidemics fail to establish regardless of Sâ‚€, creating a clear threshold boundary visible on the heatmap
                - **Nonlinear Interactions**: The relationship between P and Sâ‚€ is not simply additive - increasing both parameters simultaneously creates a stronger effect than would be predicted by changing each parameter individually
                - **Diminishing Returns**: At very high P values, further increases have minimal effect on outcomes when Sâ‚€ is limited
                - **Scale Dependence**: The epidemic threshold for P decreases as Sâ‚€ increases, meaning larger populations can sustain epidemics at lower contact probabilities
            
                **Mathematical insights:**
            
                These interactions demonstrate fundamental principles of epidemic theory:
            
                - The basic reproductive number (Râ‚€) in the Reed-Frost model is related to both P and Sâ‚€
                - The threshold effect occurs when P reaches a value where each case generates at least one new case on average

                **Key observations:**
            
                The birth rate (B) and death rate (D) together determine population dynamics and disease patterns:
            
                - **Population Stability**: When Bâ‰ˆD, the population size remains relatively stable
                - **Growing vs. Shrinking**: When B>D, the population grows, creating more susceptibles over time; when B<D, the population shrinks
                - **Turnover Effects**: Even with stable population size (Bâ‰ˆD), high values of both parameters create rapid population turnover
                - **Immunity Persistence**: High death rates can reduce population immunity by removing immune individuals
            
                **Mathematical insights:**
            
                In population models:
            
                - The difference (B-D) determines net population growth
                - Population turnover (min(B,D)) affects how quickly the population composition changes
                - In a growing population, the effective reproduction number may increase over time as susceptibles accumulate""")

                **Key observations:**
            
                This heatmap reveals how {metric.lower()} changes as a function of both {x_param.lower()} and {y_param.lower()}:
            
                - **Parameter Sensitivity**: The gradient patterns show which parameter has stronger influence on outcomes
                - **Interaction Zones**: Regions of rapid color change indicate critical combinations where small parameter shifts cause large outcome changes
                - **Threshold Effects**: Clear boundaries between light and dark regions may indicate epidemic thresholds
                - **Optimum Combinations**: The contour patterns reveal combinations of parameters that produce equivalent outcomes
            
                **Mathematical insights:**
            
                The Reed-Frost model demonstrates that:
            
                - Disease transmission is inherently nonlinear, creating complex parameter interactions
                - Some parameter combinations create compensatory effects, where changes in one parameter can offset changes in another
                - The contour lines represent sets of parameter values that yield equal epidemic outcomes""")
