    This interactive application simulates cockroach population dynamics using a Leslie Matrix model based on 
    population biology principles for studying vector and pest populations.
    Adjust the parameters using the sliders and see how they affect the population growth.
    
    **Definition**: The Leslie Matrix model is a discrete-time, age-structured population model that describes 
    population growth when age-specific survival rates and reproductive rates can be estimated. It's a fundamental 
    mathematical tool in population ecology, representing stage transitions and fecundity in a matrix format.
    
    **Core Concept**: At the heart of the Leslie Matrix model is the projection of current population structure 
    to future time steps through matrix multiplication. The matrix contains survival probabilities on the sub-diagonal 
    and fecundity values in the first row.
    
    **Leslie Matrix Equation**:
    $n_{t+1} = L n_t$
    
    Where:
    - $n_{t+1}$ is the population vector at the next time step
    - $L$ is the Leslie Matrix containing survival rates and fecundity values
    - $n_t$ is the current population vector by age class
    
    **The Model's Logic**:
    1. Each age class has a specific survival probability to the next age class
    2. Only certain adult age classes reproduce, with age-specific fecundity
    3. The population structure changes over time until reaching a stable age distribution
    4. The matrix eigenvalue determines whether the population grows, shrinks, or stabilizes
    
    **Parameters:**
    - **Egg survival rate**: Daily survival probability for eggs in the oothecae (egg cases)
    - **Nymphal survival rate**: Daily survival probability for nymphs (immature cockroaches)
    - **Adult survival rate**: Daily survival probability for adult cockroaches
    - **Initial population**: Starting number of individuals
    - **Fecundity values**: Number of eggs produced at different adult ages

    **Population Growth Analysis:**
    
    The estimated intrinsic growth rate (r) of this cockroach population is {intrinsic_growth_rate:.4f}, 
    representing the per capita rate of increase. This growth rate is determined by the interaction of 
    stage-specific survival rates and reproductive patterns.
    
    For pest species like cockroaches, population models help identify critical life stages and 
    thresholds for effective control measures. The exponential growth potential shown here

        **Cockroach Population Growth Dynamics:**
        
        This visualization reveals characteristic exponential growth patterns in cockroach populations, 
        similar to the patterns discussed in population biology literature on pest species. Several important 
        features are evident:
        
        1. **Pulse Reproduction Pattern**: Unlike continuous reproduction, cockroaches show distinct pulses of 
           reproduction as females produce oothecae at regular intervals, creating the step-like increases in 
           egg numbers. This pulse pattern is similar to the reproduction patterns observed in gonotrophic cycles 
           of some vector species.
        
        2. **Stage Duration Effects**: The relative lengths of egg and nymphal stages create a time-delayed 
           pattern of population growth, with waves of individuals moving through developmental stages. The 
           longer the nymphal stage, the greater the delay between reproduction and the emergence of new 
           reproductive adults.
        
        3. **Control Implications**: For pest management, this growth curve suggests that interventions targeting 
           adults before they reproduce will be most effective at preventing population explosions. The 
           exponential nature of the growth curve demonstrates why early detection and intervention are crucial.

        **Growth Rate Pattern Analysis:**
        
        The growth rate plot reveals how cockroach populations expand over time. The mean daily growth rate 
        of {mean_growth:.2f}% translates to significant population increases over short periods.
        
        Key observations:
        
        1. **Cyclical Growth Patterns**: The spikes in growth rate correspond to the maturation of large 
           cohorts of nymphs into reproductive adults, followed by the production of new egg cases. These 
           cycles create predictable windows for control interventions.
        
        2. **Initial Establishment Phase**: Cockroach infestations typically show a lag phase with lower 
           growth rates followed by a rapid acceleration as multiple reproducing females become established. 
           This pattern mirrors the logistic growth equation described in population ecology literature.
        
        3. **Carrying Capacity Effects**: In natural settings, growth rates would eventually decline as 
           populations approach carrying capacity due to resource limitations and density-dependent factors. 
           In human habitations, this ceiling may be much higher than in natural environments.
