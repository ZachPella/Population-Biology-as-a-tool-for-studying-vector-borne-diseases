    This interactive application simulates vector population dynamics using a Leslie Matrix model based on 
    population biology principles presented by Black & Moore for studying vector-borne diseases.
    Adjust the parameters using the sliders and see how they affect the population growth.
    
    **Definition**: The Leslie Matrix model is a discrete-time, age-structured population model that describes 
    population growth when age-specific survival rates and reproductive rates can be estimated. This fundamental 
    mathematical tool in population ecology represents stage transitions and fecundity in a matrix format.
    
    **Core Concept**: As described by Black & Moore, this matrix approach projects the current population structure 
    to future time steps through matrix multiplication, where the matrix contains survival probabilities on the sub-diagonal 
    and fecundity values in the first row.
    
    **Leslie Matrix Equation**:
    $n_{t+1} = L n_t$
    
    Where:
    - $n_{t+1}$ is the population vector at the next time step
    - $L$ is the Leslie Matrix containing survival rates and fecundity values
    - $n_t$ is the current population vector by age class
    
    **The Model's Logic**:
    1. Each age class has a specific survival probability to the next age class
    2. Only certain adult age classes reproduce, with age-specific fecundity
    3. The population structure changes over time until reaching a stable age distribution (SAD)
    4. The matrix eigenvalue determines whether the population grows, shrinks, or stabilizes
    
    **Parameters:**
    - **Daily survival rate (p)**: Probability of surviving through one day for each life stage
    - **Initial population**: Starting number of individuals
    - **Fecundity values**: Number of eggs produced at specific adult ages

    **Population Growth Analysis:**
    
    According to Black & Moore, the estimated intrinsic growth rate (r) of this vector population is {intrinsic_growth_rate:.4f}, 
    representing the per capita rate of increase.
    
    In the exponential growth model (Fig 24.4), r = {intrinsic_growth_rate:.4f} would produce exponential growth when
    positive or population decline when negative. In reality, as shown in Fig 24.5, logistic growth with carrying capacity
    constraints would eventually limit this growth.
    
    The vector-to-host ratio (m) of {vector_density:.2f} is a critical component of vectorial capacity as shown in 
    MacDonald's equation (Table 24.1).

        **Vector Population Growth Dynamics:**
        
        As described by Black & Moore, the population curve shows how vector populations change over time:
        
        1. **Exponential vs. Logistic Growth**: This model demonstrates either exponential growth (Fig 24.4) or 
           oscillating growth patterns similar to the Reed-Frost model (Fig 24.3), depending on parameter settings.
           
        2. **Pulse Reproduction Pattern**: Many vectors like mosquitoes show gonotrophic cycles with distinct 
           pulses of reproduction as females produce batches of eggs at regular intervals (Fig 24.7A).
        
        3. **Implications for Vectorial Capacity**: As shown in Table 24.1, vector density (m) is linearly 
           related to vectorial capacity, while daily survivorship (p) has non-linear effects.

        **Growth Rate Analysis:**
        
        The growth rate plot reveals how vector populations expand or contract over time. This relates to equation (14)
        in the chapter: $N_{{t+1}} = N_t + rN_t = N_t + N_t(b_0 - d_0)$ where:
        
        - Mean daily growth rate: {mean_growth:.2f}%
        - Environments with $b_0 > d_0$ lead to population growth (r > 0)
        - Environments with $d_0 > b_0$ lead to population decline (r < 0)
        
        In natural populations, growth patterns may resemble Fig 24.3 or Fig 24.5 with fluctuations due to:
        
        1. **Carrying Capacity**: As described in the chapter, real populations reach carrying capacity (K) with the 
           logistic growth model shown in Fig 24.5.
        
        2. **Density Dependence**: The text discusses how population density affects individual survival and 
           fecundity, creating natural regulation mechanisms.

        **Stable Age Distribution (SAD):**
        
        As shown in Figure 24.11 from Black & Moore, vector populations reach a stable age distribution over time:
        
        1. **Life Stage Proportions**: The proportion of individuals in each life stage stabilizes over time, 
           typically with higher proportions in immature stages than adults due to mortality patterns.
        
        2. **Equilibrium Structure**: This stable distribution is determined by stage-specific survival rates and
           the duration of each life stage. The text emphasizes that a population at SAD has a constant proportion
           of each age class.
        
        3. **Vector Control Implications**: According to the chapter, understanding the age structure is critical
           for designing effective control strategies, as it determines what proportion of the population can be 
           targeted by stage-specific control methods.

            1. **Stage-specific survival rates**: Eggs ({egg_survival:.2f}), Immatures ({immature_survival:.2f}), Adults ({adult_survival:.2f})
            2. **Stage durations**: Egg development ({egg_stage_duration} days), Immature development ({immature_stage_duration} days)
            3. **Reproductive pattern**: Following the {fecundity_pattern} pattern shown in Figure 24.7 of the text
            
            According to Figure 24.13 in the chapter, small changes in daily survivorship can dramatically affect
            population structure and size. The relative proportion of life stages is particularly important for
            vector-borne disease epidemiology because only certain stages (typically older adults that have passed

        **Age Structure Dynamics:**
        
        As Black & Moore explain in Figure 24.8, the Leslie Matrix tracks individuals through each day-age class:
        
        1. **Matrix Structure**: The Leslie Matrix contains survival probabilities on the sub-diagonal and 
           fecundity values in the first row, exactly as visualized in Figure 24.8 of the chapter.
        
        2. **Reproductive Ages**: The red bars indicate ages when vectors reproduce, reflecting the reproductive
           patterns shown in Figure 24.7 of the text. These patterns vary from multiple gonotrophic cycles in 
           mosquitoes to single-batch reproduction in ticks.
        
        3. **Age-Based Vectorial Capacity**: The text emphasizes that only older adult vectors that have survived 
           through the extrinsic incubation period can transmit pathogens, making age structure particularly
           important in disease epidemiology.

                    compared to other parameters. Black & Moore note that daily survival rates can be measured using 
                    mark-release-recapture methods or physiological age grading techniques to track cohorts.

        **Leslie-Lewis Matrix Model:**
        
        This visualization shows the Leslie Matrix as described in Figure 24.8 of the chapter:
        
        1. **Matrix Structure**: As described by Black & Moore, the Leslie Matrix contains:
           - Fecundity values in the first row (reproductive output at each age)
           - Survival probabilities on the sub-diagonal (transition rates between age classes)
           - Zeros elsewhere
        
        2. **Matrix Multiplication**: The Leslie-Lewis approach projects the current population to future time steps
           through matrix multiplication: $n_{t+1} = L n_t$ where L is the Leslie Matrix and $n_t$ is the
           population vector by age class.
        
        3. **Stable Age Distribution**: An important result of iterating this matrix, as shown in Figure 24.11,
           is that the population reaches a stable age distribution (SAD) where the proportion of each age class
           remains constant, even as total population size continues to grow.

        **Life Table Analysis:**
        
        Tables 24.2 and 24.3 in the text show examples of life tables for vectors:
        
        1. **Life Table Components**: As described by Black & Moore, life tables combine:
           - Chronological age (days)
           - Age-specific survival rates (p)
           - Age-specific fecundity (f)
        
        2. **Age Classes**: The text emphasizes that "age classes must be of equal length for the model to be accurate."
           This model uses day-age classes rather than life stages to ensure precise tracking of individuals.
        
        3. **Applications**: Life tables enable the prediction of population growth and age structure,
           which are critical for understanding vectorial capacity and the efficacy of control measures.

    ### Vector Control Strategy Insights
    
    Black & Moore discuss critical implications for vector control:
    
    1. **Vectorial Capacity Targeting**:
       - As shown in Table 24.1, vectorial capacity (V) is affected differently by various parameters
       - Small changes in daily survival rate (p) have substantial impacts on vectorial capacity
       - Figure 24.13 demonstrates how reducing survival rates affects final population size
    
    2. **Economic Thresholds**:
       - The text discusses that vector control aims to keep populations below economic thresholds
       - Control efforts should focus on the most cost-effective parameters to target
       - Mathematical models help identify optimal control strategies
    
    3. **Larval vs Adult Control**:
       - The authors note that targeting different life stages produces different outcomes
       - Figure 24.13 shows that reducing egg survivorship may be more efficient than targeting adults
       - The text cautions that density dependence can complicate control outcomes - reducing larval 
         numbers can sometimes lead to better survival of remaining larvae

    ### Practical Applications of Population Models
    
    In their conclusion, Black & Moore emphasize several important points:
    
    1. **Model Limitations**:
       - The authors explicitly caution: "these models are only didactic tools and 
         are largely inaccurate in their predictions concerning natural populations"
       - Real vector populations are more complex than these idealized representations
       - Models should be used for comparative rather than absolute predictions
    
    2. **Data Collection Challenges**:
       - The text describes methods for measuring key parameters like survival rates and fecundity
       - Techniques include mark-release-recapture, physiological age grading, and cohort analysis
       - Accurate field measurements are challenging but essential
    
    3. **Comparative Approach**:
       - Black & Moore recommend using a "comparative" rather than "absolute" approach
       - Understanding the relative importance of different factors is more useful than obtaining precise values
       - These models can guide control strategies by identifying which parameters most strongly influence vectorial capacity
    
    These mathematical approaches demonstrate how population biology can guide practical vector control
    by identifying the most effective intervention points based on understanding population structure and dynamics.
