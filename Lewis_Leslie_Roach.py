    This interactive application simulates cockroach population dynamics using a Leslie Matrix model based on 
    population biology principles for studying vector and pest populations.
    Adjust the parameters using the sliders and see how they affect the population growth.
    
    **Definition**: The Leslie Matrix model is a discrete-time, age-structured population model that describes 
    population growth when age-specific survival rates and reproductive rates can be estimated. It's a fundamental 
    mathematical tool in population ecology, representing stage transitions and fecundity in a matrix format.
    
    **Core Concept**: At the heart of the Leslie Matrix model is the projection of current population structure 
    to future time steps through matrix multiplication. The matrix contains survival probabilities on the sub-diagonal 
    and fecundity values in the first row.
    
    **Leslie Matrix Equation**:
    $n_{t+1} = L n_t$
    
    Where:
    - $n_{t+1}$ is the population vector at the next time step
    - $L$ is the Leslie Matrix containing survival rates and fecundity values
    - $n_t$ is the current population vector by age class
    
    **The Model's Logic**:
    1. Each age class has a specific survival probability to the next age class
    2. Only certain adult age classes reproduce, with age-specific fecundity
    3. The population structure changes over time until reaching a stable age distribution
    4. The matrix eigenvalue determines whether the population grows, shrinks, or stabilizes
    
    **Parameters:**
    - **Egg survival rate**: Daily survival probability for eggs in the oothecae (egg cases)
    - **Nymphal survival rate**: Daily survival probability for nymphs (immature cockroaches)
    - **Adult survival rate**: Daily survival probability for adult cockroaches
    - **Initial population**: Starting number of individuals
    - **Fecundity values**: Number of eggs produced at different adult ages

        **Cockroach Population Growth Dynamics:**
        
        This visualization reveals characteristic growth patterns in cockroach populations as discussed by Black & Moore:
        
        1. **Pulse Reproduction Pattern**: Similar to the pattern shown in Figure 24.7A, cockroaches show distinct pulses of 
           reproduction as females produce oothecae at regular intervals, creating the step-like increases in 
           egg numbers. This pattern resembles the gonotrophic cycles described for some vector species.
        
        2. **Stage Duration Effects**: The relative lengths of egg and nymphal stages create a time-delayed 
           pattern of population growth, with waves of individuals moving through developmental stages. The 
           longer the nymphal stage, the greater the delay between reproduction and the emergence of new 
           reproductive adults.
        
        3. **Control Implications**: The exponential or logistic pattern displayed in this model (similar to Fig. 24.4 and 24.5)
           suggests that interventions targeting adults before they reproduce would be most effective at preventing 
           population explosions. The growth curve demonstrates why early detection and intervention are crucial.

        **Growth Rate Pattern Analysis:**
        
        The growth rate plot reveals how cockroach populations expand over time, with a mean daily growth rate 
        of {mean_growth:.2f}%. This relates to the equation Nt+1 = Nt + rNt discussed by Black & Moore.
        
        Key observations:
        
        1. **Cyclical Growth Patterns**: The spikes in growth rate correspond to the maturation of large 
           cohorts of nymphs into reproductive adults, followed by the production of new egg cases. In natural
           settings, these cycles might create predictable windows for control interventions.
        
        2. **Initial Establishment Phase**: Population growth shows an initial phase followed by acceleration,
           similar to patterns described in the text. The pattern relates to equation (14) in the chapter where 
           bâ‚€ > dâ‚€ results in positive population growth.
        
        3. **Carrying Capacity Effects**: In natural settings, growth rates would eventually decline as 
           populations approach carrying capacity (as shown in Fig. 24.5) due to resource limitations and 
           density-dependent factors. In human habitations, this ceiling may be much higher than in natural environments.

        **Cockroach Stage Distribution Dynamics:**
        
        This visualization shows how the cockroach population structure evolves over time, eventually reaching 
        a stable age distribution (SAD) as described in Figure 24.11 of Black & Moore. In cockroach populations, 
        this structural pattern has important implications:
        
        1. **Hidden Infestation Indicators**: The high proportion of eggs and nymphs (often >70% of the total 
           population) explains why cockroach infestations are often much larger than apparent from visible adults. 
           This "population iceberg" effect is critical for pest management planning.
        
        2. **Resilience Mechanism**: The extended development time of nymphs creates a buffer against control 
           measures - even if all adults are eliminated, the nymphal reservoir ensures population recovery. 
           This resilience mechanism is similar to the demographic dynamics described in the text.
        
        3. **Control Strategy Implications**: The eventual stable proportion of each life stage determines what 
           fraction of the population can be targeted by stage-specific control methods (e.g., growth regulators 
           vs. adult baits). Effective management requires addressing all life stages present in the stable 
           distribution.

            **Final Population Structure Analysis:**
            
            The pie chart shows the stable age distribution reached after {num_days} days. According to the concepts in
            Black & Moore, this equilibrium structure is determined by:
            
            1. **Stage-specific survival rates**: Eggs ({egg_survival:.2f}), Nymphs ({nymphal_survival:.2f}), Adults ({adult_survival:.2f})
            2. **Stage durations**: Egg development ({egg_stage_duration} days), Nymphal development ({nymphal_stage_duration} days)
            3. **Reproductive pattern**: Similar to Fig 24.7A, with oviposition occurring at days 12, 17, 22, and 27 of adult life
            
            Cockroach populations typically show a much higher proportion of nymphs than adults due to their 
            extended developmental period. This creates challenges for control programs, as the majority of the 
            population is in life stages that may be less susceptible to certain control measures and often 
            hide in inaccessible locations.
            
            As noted in the text, this stable structure helps explain why cockroach control often requires sustained effort 
            rather than one-time treatments - the age distribution ensures a constant supply of developing 
            individuals to replace eliminated adults.

        **Cockroach Population Age Structure:**
        
        This visualization displays the detailed age distribution of the cockroach population, similar to the Leslie-Lewis
        matrix approach shown in Figure 24.8 of Black & Moore. The horizontal bars represent specific 
        day-age classes, providing insights into cockroach population dynamics:
        
        1. **Reproductive Timing**: The red bars indicate ages when females produce oothecae (egg cases). Similar to 
           the pattern shown in Figure 24.7A, cockroaches show distinct reproductive pulses, creating cohorts 
           that move through the population together.
        
        2. **Development Bottlenecks**: Transitions between life stages (marked by dotted lines) can represent 
           vulnerable periods in the cockroach life cycle. As noted in the text, control strategies can be
           optimized by targeting specific life stages based on their survival rates.
        
        3. **Cohort Identification**: The distinct "waves" of individuals at specific ages indicates separate 
           cohorts moving through the population. As discussed by Black & Moore, understanding these age-structured
           dynamics is crucial for effective pest management.
        
        The model uses daily age classes rather than simple life stages to accurately track individuals through time,
        which as the authors note is essential for precise population models.
