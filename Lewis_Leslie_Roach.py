        **Cockroach Population Growth Dynamics:**
        
        This visualization reveals characteristic exponential growth patterns in cockroach populations, 
        similar to the patterns discussed in population biology literature on pest species. Several important 
        features are evident:
        
        1. **Pulse Reproduction Pattern**: Unlike continuous reproduction, cockroaches show distinct pulses of 
           reproduction as females produce oothecae at regular intervals, creating the step-like increases in 
           egg numbers. This pulse pattern is similar to the reproduction patterns observed in gonotrophic cycles 
           of some vector species.
        
        2. **Stage Duration Effects**: The relative lengths of egg and nymphal stages create a time-delayed 
           pattern of population growth, with waves of individuals moving through developmental stages. The 
           longer the nymphal stage, the greater the delay between reproduction and the emergence of new 
           reproductive adults.
        
        3. **Control Implications**: For pest management, this growth curve suggests that interventions targeting 
           adults before they reproduce will be most effective at preventing population explosions. The 
           exponential nature of the growth curve demonstrates why early detection and intervention are crucial.

        **Growth Rate Pattern Analysis:**
        
        The growth rate plot reveals how cockroach populations expand over time. The mean daily growth rate 
        of {mean_growth:.2f}% translates to significant population increases over short periods.
        
        Key observations:
        
        1. **Cyclical Growth Patterns**: The spikes in growth rate correspond to the maturation of large 
           cohorts of nymphs into reproductive adults, followed by the production of new egg cases. These 
           cycles create predictable windows for control interventions.
        
        2. **Initial Establishment Phase**: Cockroach infestations typically show a lag phase with lower 
           growth rates followed by a rapid acceleration as multiple reproducing females become established. 
           This pattern mirrors the logistic growth equation described in population ecology literature.
        
        3. **Carrying Capacity Effects**: In natural settings, growth rates would eventually decline as 
           populations approach carrying capacity due to resource limitations and density-dependent factors. 
           In human habitations, this ceiling may be much higher than in natural environments.

        **Cockroach Stage Distribution Dynamics:**
        
        This visualization shows how the cockroach population structure evolves over time, eventually reaching 
        a stable age distribution (SAD) - a fundamental concept in population biology. In cockroach populations, 
        this structural pattern has important implications:
        
        1. **Hidden Infestation Indicators**: The high proportion of eggs and nymphs (often >70% of the total 
           population) explains why cockroach infestations are often much larger than apparent from visible adults. 
           This "population iceberg" effect is critical for pest management planning.
        
        2. **Resilience Mechanism**: The extended development time of nymphs creates a buffer against control 
           measures - even if all adults are eliminated, the nymphal reservoir ensures population recovery. 
           This resilience mechanism is similar to the "demographic momentum" described in population models.
        
        3. **Control Strategy Implications**: The eventual stable proportion of each life stage determines what 
           fraction of the population can be targeted by stage-specific control methods (e.g., growth regulators 
           vs. adult baits). Effective management requires addressing all life stages present in the stable 
           distribution.

            **Final Population Structure Analysis:**
            
            The pie chart shows the stable age distribution reached after {num_days} days. This equilibrium 
            structure is determined by:
            
            1. **Stage-specific survival rates**: Eggs ({egg_survival:.2f}), Nymphs ({nymphal_survival:.2f}), Adults ({adult_survival:.2f})
            2. **Stage durations**: Egg development ({egg_stage_duration} days), Nymphal development ({nymphal_stage_duration} days)
            3. **Reproductive pattern**: Oviposition occurring at days 12, 17, 22, and 27 of adult life
            
            Cockroach populations typically show a much higher proportion of nymphs than adults due to their 
            extended developmental period. This creates challenges for control programs, as the majority of the 
            population is in life stages that may be less susceptible to certain control measures and often 
            hide in inaccessible locations.
            
            The stable structure shown here helps explain why cockroach control often requires sustained effort 
            rather than one-time treatments - the age distribution ensures a constant supply of developing 
            individuals to replace eliminated adults.

        **Cockroach Population Age Structure:**
        
        This visualization displays the detailed age distribution of the cockroach population, revealing patterns 
        that are not apparent in the aggregated life stage counts. The horizontal bars represent specific 
        day-age classes, providing insights into cockroach population dynamics:
        
        1. **Reproductive Timing**: The red bars indicate ages when females produce oothecae (egg cases). Unlike 
           species with continuous reproduction, cockroaches show distinct reproductive pulses, creating cohorts 
           that move through the population together.
        
        2. **Development Bottlenecks**: Transitions between life stages (marked by dotted lines) can represent 
           vulnerable periods in the cockroach life cycle. For example, nymphs undergoing molting may be more 
           susceptible to certain control measures, creating windows of opportunity for management interventions.
        
        3. **Cohort Identification**: The distinct "waves" of individuals at specific ages indicates separate 
           cohorts moving through the population. In pest management, identifying these cohort patterns can help 
           time control measures for maximum effectiveness.
        
        The discrete age structure shown here is particularly important for understanding German cockroach dynamics, 
        as this species carries its oothecae until just before hatching rather than depositing them earlier.

        **Cockroach Cohort Survival Patterns:**
        
        This survival curve tracks eggs from deposition through development, revealing mortality patterns 
        characteristic of cockroach populations. The shape of this curve provides insights into cockroach 
        life history strategies:
        
        1. **Survival Strategy**: Cockroaches typically exhibit a Type II survivorship curve with relatively 
           constant mortality rates across life stages. This differs from many insect species that show high 
           early mortality (Type III). The protected development of eggs within oothecae contributes to this pattern.
        
        2. **Stage-Specific Vulnerability**: The vertical lines mark transitions between life stages, often 
           associated with changes in survival probability. For cockroaches, the transition from protected eggs 
           to mobile nymphs can be a period of increased risk.
        
        3. **Management Implications**: Control strategies that alter this survivorship curve by increasing 
           mortality at specific life stages can effectively suppress population growth. For example, bait 
           formulations specifically targeting nymphs could steepen the curve during that life stage.
        
        4. **Resistance Development**: The shape of this curve also influences how quickly resistance to control 
           measures can evolve - populations with higher adult survival rates have more opportunities for 
           selection of resistant individuals.

                       a reduction of approximately {((1-estimated_daily_survival/0.95)*100):.1f}% in daily survival 
                       would be needed to halt population growth.

        **Cockroach Population Matrix Model:**
        
        The Leslie Matrix is the mathematical engine of this cockroach population model. For cockroach populations, 
        this matrix approach captures several key biological features:
        
        1. **Protected Reproduction**: The first row (fecundity values) shows the pulse reproduction pattern, with 
           reproduction concentrated at specific adult ages corresponding to ootheca production cycles. This contrasts 
           with species that show more continuous reproduction.
        
        2. **Stage-Structured Survival**: The subdiagonal elements represent transitions between age classes with 
           stage-specific survival rates. For cockroaches, these survival rates are often higher than many other 
           insects due to their hardiness and protected development.
        
        3. **Time-Delayed Dynamics**: The matrix structure inherently captures the developmental delays between 
           egg deposition and the emergence of reproductive adults. These delays create the cyclic patterns 
           observed in cockroach population growth.
        
        The Leslie Matrix approach is particularly valuable for cockroach management as it allows prediction of 
        future population structure and identification of critical control points in the life cycle.

        **Cockroach Life Table Analysis:**
        
        The data tables below provide a detailed demographic description of the cockroach population over time. 
        For pest management purposes, this life table approach offers several advantages:
        
        1. **Detection Probability**: The life table shows what proportion of the population is visible at any time. 
           Since only adults are typically observed, traditional sampling methods may severely underestimate actual 
           infestation levels by missing eggs and hidden nymphs.
        
        2. **Control Evaluation**: By comparing the age structure before and after control measures, managers can 
           assess whether interventions are affecting all life stages or just the more visible adults. Effective 
           control should reduce numbers across all age classes.
        
        3. **Rebound Prediction**: The age structure data allows prediction of population recovery after control 
           efforts. A high proportion of late-stage nymphs indicates that adult numbers will soon increase even if 
           current adult counts are low.
        
        4. **Seasonal Dynamics**: For species like the American cockroach that show seasonal reproduction peaks, 
           the life table approach helps identify optimal timing for preventive control measures before population 
           explosions occur.

    ### Cockroach Management Strategy Insights
    
    This population model provides critical insights for developing effective cockroach control strategies. 
    Several key management implications emerge from the Leslie Matrix approach:
    
    1. **Control Timing and Targeting**:
       - **Life Stage Vulnerability**: Different life stages show different susceptibilities to control measures
       - **Early Intervention**: The exponential growth pattern means early detection and control is critical
       - **Sustained Approaches**: The stable age distribution indicates that one-time treatments will be ineffective
    
    2. **Integrated Management Approaches**:
       - **Multiple Control Methods**: Using both growth regulators (targeting nymphs) and adulticides
       - **Habitat Modification**: Reducing carrying capacity through sanitation to limit population growth
       - **Barriers and Exclusion**: Preventing population establishment through physical exclusion
    
    3. **Resistance Management**:
       - **Rotation of Control Agents**: Preventing selection for resistance by using multiple control approaches
       - **Population Reservoirs**: Addressing hidden populations of eggs and nymphs that can harbor resistance genes
       - **Complete Elimination**: Targeting all life stages to prevent selective survival of resistant individuals

    ### Control Strategy Comparison
    
    The plot above compares how different control strategies affect adult cockroach populations over time. 
    This analysis reveals several important patterns specific to cockroach management:
    
    **1. Adult vs. Nymphal Control Effectiveness:**
    
    - **Adult Control (Gray Line)**: Shows immediate reduction in adult numbers but may have less long-term impact
      due to the reservoir of developing nymphs that will mature into adults
      
    - **Nymphal Control (Orange Line)**: Shows a delayed but potentially more sustained reduction by preventing
      nymphs from reaching reproductive age, effectively breaking the population cycle
    
    **2. Timing Considerations:**
    
    - Adult control measures produce immediate visible results (beneficial for client satisfaction)
    - Nymphal control measures show delayed effectiveness (important for long-term management)
    - Optimal strategy often combines both approaches for both immediate and sustained control
    
    **3. Practical Applications:**
    
    - **Baits with IGRs** (Insect Growth Regulators): Target both adults and prevent nymphal development
    - **Dust formulations**: Effective against harboring areas where eggs and nymphs develop
    - **Integrated approaches**: Combining chemical control with habitat modification and exclusion
    
    The comparative effectiveness of these strategies depends on the specific cockroach species and 
    environmental conditions, but the matrix model provides a framework for predicting outcomes under
    different scenarios.

    ### From Population Biology to Practical Pest Management
    
    This Leslie Matrix model bridges theoretical population biology and practical cockroach management by
    demonstrating how age structure, survival rates, and reproductive patterns interact to determine 
    population growth and control effectiveness:
    
    1. **Predictive Power**:
       - The model allows prediction of infestation development over time
       - It reveals the "hidden" component of infestations (eggs and early nymphs)
       - It helps anticipate population rebounds after incomplete control efforts
    
    2. **Management Optimization**:
       - Optimal timing of treatments can be determined based on population structure
       - Resource allocation can be guided by identifying most effective intervention points
       - Treatment frequency can be planned based on predicted population recovery rates
    
    3. **Resistance Prevention**:
       - Understanding population structure helps design strategies that minimize selection for resistance
       - Targeting multiple life stages simultaneously reduces selective pressure on any single stage
       - Monitoring age structure can provide early warning of control failures
    
    4. **Evaluation Metrics**:
       - Success of control programs should be measured not just by adult reduction but by changes in
         population structure across all life stages
       - The stable age distribution concept provides a benchmark for determining when true population
         suppression has been achieved
    
    This model demonstrates how principles from population ecology can directly inform practical pest 
    management, leading to more effective and sustainable cockroach control strategies.
